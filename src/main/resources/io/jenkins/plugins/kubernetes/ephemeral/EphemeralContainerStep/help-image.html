        Container image reference for the container. The image must have a shell available (i.e. `sh`).
    </p>
    <p>
        If the image defines an entrypoint it must be able to accept and execute a command and
        arguments. Jenkins must be able to stop the container and to do so it passes a process
        monitor command to know when to exit the container. If the image entrypoint to not
        perform the monitor task the ephemeral container may not work correctly.
    </p>
    <p>Configure an empty <code>command</code> list to disable the entrypoint.</p>
    <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> Windows containers are not supported.
