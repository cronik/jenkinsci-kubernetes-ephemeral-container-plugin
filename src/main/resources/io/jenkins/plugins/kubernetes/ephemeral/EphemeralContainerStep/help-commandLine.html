        Override the image entrypoint.
    </p>
    <p>
        If an empty array, disable the default image entrypoint with the Jenkins monitor command.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a non-empty command is provided, it <strong>must be able to accept a monitor command and arguments which must be executed</strong>.
        If entrypoint ignores the Jenkins provided monitor command the step may either exit early or failed to be terminated.
    </p>
<pre><code>sh '''#!/bin/bash
# do some custom entrypoint stuff

# execute monitor command provided by jenkins
exec "$@"
'''</code></pre>
