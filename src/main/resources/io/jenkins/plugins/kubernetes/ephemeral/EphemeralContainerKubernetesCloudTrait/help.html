        Enable execution of steps within <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/ephemeral-containers/">Ephemeral Containers</a>.
        Ephemeral containers are added to the build agent Pod using the <code>withEphemeralContainer</code> step. The newly
        created container will share the same workspace volume and <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/#pod-networking">network</a>
        as other containers in the Pod and so behave similar to the <a href="https://www.jenkins.io/doc/pipeline/steps/kubernetes/#container-run-build-steps-in-a-container">container</a>
        step. The difference is <code>withEphemeralContainer</code> will terminated the container when the <code>withEphemeralContainer</code> block exits.

    <p>
        The Ephemeral Container spec does not allow for specifying resources, but will still be subject to the
        <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/">Pod overall
        resource limits</a>. The kubelet may evict a Pod if an ephemeral container causes the Pod to exceed its resource
        allocation. <strong>To avoid eviction it is advisable to increase the limits of the primary container to account for
        potential ephemeral container resource requirements.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        In Kubernetes, the size limit for objects stored in etcd, including pod specs, is 1.5MB per key-value pair.
        This means there is a finite number of ephemeral containers that may be added to a build agent. This is usually
        not much of an issue for most pipelines, but could become an issue for long-running Pods. <strong>For this reason
        it is not recommended to re-use agent nodes for multiple builds. Setting the Pod Template idle minutes property
        ("Time in minutes to retain agent when idle") to <code>0</code> is a good practice.</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        Because pipelines are able to run arbitrary images, some clouds may choose to disable this feature or limit
        the allowed images (i.e. <code>Container Image Rule</code>) for security reasons.
    </p>
    <p>
        When enabled the build environment variable <code>KUBERNETES_CLOUD_EPHEMERAL_CONTAINERS_ENABLED=true</code> will be
        added to signal to pipeline scripts the <code>withEphemeralContainer</code> step is available for use.

        <strong>Note:</strong> Ephemeral Containers are GA in Kubernetes 1.25+. Prior versions may require a
        <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/feature-gates/">feature gate</a> to
        enable.
