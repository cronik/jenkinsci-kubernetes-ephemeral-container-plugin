        Specifies a shell which will run inside the container
        and process requests from Jenkins to run executables,
        set environment variables, and similar infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
        This does <strong>not</strong> affect the shell used to run user code,
        such as <code>sh</code> steps.
        To run your scripts with a specific shell on Linux, use an interpreter line:
    </p>
    <pre><code>sh '''#!/bin/bash
    for x in {0..9}; do echo x; done
    '''</code></pre>
    <p>
        or just use a subprocess and an externally versioned script:
    </p>
    <pre><code>sh 'bash ci.sh'</code></pre>
    <p>
        For a pod running on Linux, defaults to <code>sh</code>, which should be in <code>$PATH</code>.
        Should not generally be overridden.
